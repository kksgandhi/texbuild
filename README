This small script continuously builds a latex file in the background.
Importantly, it only overwrites the target pdf file upon a successful and complete build.
This allows you to watch the PDf in a PDF viewer without the PDF viewer corrupting or crashing because of an incomplete PDF.

See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1240037/recommended-build-system-for-latex/1394702#1394702 for motivation and usage instruction.

Note: This repository is a fork. There are two major updates; firstly, it works for python3, secondly, it puts all output in a folder (default folder name is 'output', however that can be changed using the config variables at the top of `texbuild.py`)
